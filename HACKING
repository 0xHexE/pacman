Coding style
------------

1.  All code should be indented with tabs. (Ignore the use of only spaces in
    this file) By default, source files contain the following VIM modeline:
      /* vim: set ts=2 sw=2 noet: */

2.  When opening new blocks such as 'while', 'if', or 'for', leave the opening
    brace on the same line as the beginning of the codeblock. The closing brace
    gets its own line (the only exception being 'else'). Do not use extra
    spaces around the parentheses of the block. ALWAYS use opening/closing
    braces, even if it's just a one-line block.

    for(lp = list; lp; lp = lp->next) {
      newlist = _alpm_list_add(newlist, strdup(lp->data));
    }

    while(it) {
      ptr = it->next;
      if(fn) {
        fn(it->data);
      } else {
        return(1);
      }
      free(it);
      it = ptr;
    }

3.  When declaring a new function, put the opening and closing braces on their
    own line. Also, when declaring a pointer, do not put a space between the
    asterisk and the variable name.

    pmlist_t *_alpm_list_add(pmlist_t *list, void *data)
    {
      pmlist_t *ptr, *lp;

      ptr = list;
     if(ptr == NULL) {
    ...
    }

4.  Comments should be ANSI-C89 compliant. That means no "// Comment" style;
    use only "/* Comment */" style.

5.  Return statements should be written like a function call.

    return(0);
       NOT
    return 0;

6.  The sizeof() operator should accept a type, not a value. (TODO: in certain
    cases, it may be better- should this be a set guideline? Read "The Practice
    of Programming")

    sizeof(alpm_list_t);
       NOT
    sizeof(*mylist);

vim: set ts=2 sw=2 et:
