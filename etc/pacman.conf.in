# REPOSITORIES
#   - can be defined here or included from another file
#   - pacman will search repositories in the order defined here
#   - local/custom mirrors can be added here or in separate files
#   - repositories listed first will take precedence when packages
#     have identical names, regardless of version number
#
# Repository entries are of the format:
#       [repo-name]
#       Server = ServerName
#       Include = IncludePath
#
# The header [repo-name] is crucial - it must be present and
# uncommented to enable the repo.
#

# Testing is disabled by default.  To enable, uncomment the following
# two lines.  You can add preferred servers immediately after the header,
# and they will be used before the default mirrors.
#[testing]
#Include = @sysconfdir@/pacman.d/mirrorlist

[core]
# Add your preferred servers here, they will be used first
Include = @sysconfdir@/pacman.d/mirrorlist

[extra]
# Add your preferred servers here, they will be used first
Include = @sysconfdir@/pacman.d/mirrorlist

# and they will be used before the default mirrors.
