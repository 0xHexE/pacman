Name
----
pacman.conf - pacman package manager configuration file


Synopsis
--------
{sysconfdir}/pacman.conf


Description
-----------
Pacman, using linkman:libalpm[3], will attempt to read pacman.conf each time it
is invoked. This configuration file is divided into sections or repositories.
Each section defines a package repository that pacman can use when searching
for packages in '\--sync' mode. The exception to this is the options section,
which defines global options.


Example
-------
--------
#
# pacman.conf
#
[options]
NoUpgrade = etc/passwd etc/group etc/shadow
NoUpgrade = etc/fstab

[core]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/core

[custom]
Server = file:///home/pkgs
--------

NOTE: Each directive must be in CamelCase. If the case isn't respected, the
directive won't be recognized. For example. noupgrade or NOUPGRADE will not
work.

Options
-------
*RootDir =* path/to/root::
	Set the default root directory for pacman to install to. This option is
	used if you want to install a package on a temporary mounted partition
	which is "owned" by another system, or for a chroot install.
	*NOTE*: If database path or logfile are not specified on either the
	command line or in linkman:pacman.conf[5], their default location will
	be inside this root path.

*DBPath =* path/to/db/dir::
	Overrides the default location of the toplevel database directory.  A
	typical default is ``/var/lib/pacman/''. Most users will not need to set
	this option. *NOTE*: if specified, this is an absolute path and the root
	path is not automatically prepended.

*CacheDir =* path/to/cache/dir::
	Overrides the default location of the package cache directory. A typical
	default is ``/var/cache/pacman/pkg/''. Multiple cache directories can be
	specified, and they are tried in the order they are listed in the config
	file. If a file is not found in any cache directory, it will be downloaded
	to the first cache directory with write access. *NOTE*: this is an absolute
	path, the root path is not automatically prepended.


*LogFile =* '/path/to/file'::
	Overrides the default location of the pacman log file. A typical default
	is ``/var/log/pacman.log''. This is an absolute path and the root directory
	is not prepended.

*HoldPkg =* package ...::
	If a user tries to '\--remove' a package that's listed in `HoldPkg`,
	pacman will ask for confirmation before proceeding.

*IgnorePkg =* package ...::
	Instructs pacman to ignore any upgrades for this package when performing
	a '\--sysupgrade'.

*SyncFirst =* package ...::
	Instructs pacman to check for newer version of these packages before any
	sync operation. The user will have the choice to either cancel the current
	operation and upgrade these packages first or go on with the current operation.
	This option is typically used with the 'pacman' package.

*IgnoreGroup =* group ...::
	Instructs pacman to ignore any upgrades for all packages in this
	group when performing a '\--sysupgrade'.

*Include =* path::
	Include another config file. This file can include repositories or
	general configuration  options.

*XferCommand =* /path/to/command %u::
	If set, an external program will be used to download all remote files.
	All instances of `%u` will be replaced with the download URL. If present,
	instances of `%o` will be replaced with the local filename, plus a
	``.part'' extension, which allows programs like wget to do file resumes
	properly.
	+
	This option is useful for users who experience problems with built-in
	http/ftp support, or need the more advanced proxy support that comes with
	utilities like wget.

*NoPassiveFtp*::
	Disables passive ftp connections when downloading packages. (aka Active Mode)

*NoUpgrade =* file ...::
	All files listed with a `NoUpgrade` directive will never be touched during
	a package install/upgrade.
	These files refer to files in the package archive, so do not include the
	leading slash (the RootDir) when specifying them.

*NoExtract =* file ...::
	All files listed with a `NoExtract` directive will never be extracted from
	a package into the filesystem. This can be useful when you don't want part
	of a package to be installed. For example, if your httpd root uses an
	'index.php', then you would not want the 'index.html' file to be extracted
	from the 'apache' package.
	These files refer to files in the package archive, so do not include the
	leading slash (the RootDir) when specifying them.

*CleanMethod =* KeepInstalled | KeepCurrent::
	If set to `KeepInstalled` (the default), the '-Sc' operation will clean
	packages that are no longer installed (not present in the local database).
	If set to `KeepCurrent`, '-Sc' will clean outdated packages (not present in
	any sync database).
	The second behavior is useful when the package cache is shared among
	multiple machines, where the local databases are usually different, but the
	sync databases in use could be the same.

*UseSyslog*::
	Log action messages through syslog(). This will insert log entries into
	``/var/log/messages'' or equivalent.

*ShowSize*::
	Display the size of individual packages for '\--sync' and '\--query' modes.

*UseDelta*::
	Download delta files instead of complete packages if possible.  Requires
	the xdelta program to be installed.

*TotalDownload*::
	When downloading, display the amount downloaded, download rate, ETA,
	and completed percentage of the entire download list rather
	than the percent of each individual download target. The progress
	bar is still based solely on the current file download.

Repository Sections
-------------------
Each repository section defines a section name and at least one location where
the packages can be found. The section name is defined by the string within
square brackets (the two above are 'current'  and  'custom'). Locations are
defined with the 'Server' directive and follow a URL naming structure. If you
want to use a local directory, you can specify the full path with a ``file://''
prefix, as shown above.

A common way to define DB locations utilizes the 'Include' directive. For each
repository defined in the configuration file, a single 'Include' directive can
contain a file that lists the servers for that repository.

--------
[core]
# use this repository first
Server = ftp://ftp.archlinux.org/core/os/arch
# next use servers as defined in the mirrorlist below
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
--------

During parsing, pacman will define the `$repo` variable to the name of the
current section. This is often utilized in files specified using the 'Include'
directive so all repositories can use the same mirrorfile.

--------
Server = ftp://ftp.archlinux.org/$repo/os/arch
--------

The order of repositories in the configuration files matters; repositories
listed first will take precedence over those listed later in the file when
packages in two repositories have identical names, regardless of version
number.

Using Your Own Repository
-------------------------
If you have numerous custom packages of your own, it is often easier to generate
your own custom local repository than install them all with the '\--upgrade'
option. All you need to do is generate a compressed package database in the
directory with these packages so pacman can find it when run with '\--refresh'.

	repo-add /home/pkgs/custom.db.tar.gz /home/pkgs/*.pkg.tar.gz

The above command will generate a compressed database named
'/home/pkgs/custom.db.tar.gz'. Note that the database must be of the form
'{treename}.db.tar.gz', where '{treename}' is the name of the section defined in
the configuration file. That's it! Now configure your custom section in the
configuration file as shown in the config example above. Pacman will now use your
package repository. If you add new packages to the repository, remember to
re-generate the database and use pacman's '\--refresh' option.

For more information on the repo-add command, see ``repo-add \--help'' or
linkman:repo-add[8].
