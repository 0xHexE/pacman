Name
----
pacman.conf - pacman package manager configuration file


Synopsis
--------
{sysconfdir}/pacman.conf


Description
-----------
Pacman, using manlink:libalpm[3], will attempt to read pacman.conf each time it
is invoked. This configuration file is divided into sections or repositories.
Each section defines a package repository that pacman can use when searching
for packages in '\--sync' mode. The exception to this is the options section,
which defines global options.


Example
-------
--------
#
# pacman.conf
#
[options]
NoUpgrade = etc/passwd etc/group etc/shadow
NoUpgrade = etc/fstab

[current]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/current

[custom]
Server = file:///home/pkgs
--------


Options
-------
*RootDir =* path/to/root::
	Set the default root directory for pacman to install to.

*DBPath =* path/to/db/dir::
	Overrides the default location of the toplevel database directory.
	The default is ``/var/lib/pacman/''.

*CacheDir =* path/to/cache/dir::
	Overrides the default location of the package cache directory. The default
	is ``/var/cache/pacman/pkg/''. Multiple cache directories can be specified,
	and they are tried in the order they are listed in the config file. If a
	file is not found in any cache directory, it will be downloaded to the
	first cache directory with write access.

*LogFile =* '/path/to/file'::
	Log actions directly to a file. Default is ``/var/log/pacman.log''.

*HoldPkg =* package ...::
	If a user tries to '\--remove' a package that's listed in `HoldPkg`,
	pacman will ask for confirmation before proceeding.

*IgnorePkg =* package ...::
	Instructs pacman to ignore any upgrades for this package when performing
	a '\--sysupgrade'.

*Include =* path::
	Include another config file. This file can include repositories or
	general configuration  options.

*XferCommand =* /path/to/command %u::
	If set, an external program will be used to download all remote files.
	All instances of `%u` will be replaced with the download URL. If present,
	instances of `%o` will be replaced with the local filename, plus a
	``.part'' extension, which allows programs like wget to do file resumes
	properly.
	+
	This option is useful for users who experience problems with built-in
	http/ftp support, or need the more advanced proxy support that comes with
	utilities like wget.

*NoPassiveFtp*::
	Disables passive ftp connections when downloading packages. (aka Active Mode)

*NoUpgrade =* file ...::
	All files listed with a `NoUpgrade` directive will never be touched during
	a package install/upgrade. Do not include the leading slash when specifying
	files.

*NoExtract =* file ...::
	All files listed with a `NoExtract` directive will never be extracted from
	a package into the filesystem. This can be useful when you don't want part
	of a package to be installed. For example, if your httpd root uses an
	'index.php', then you would not want the 'index.html' file to be extracted
	from the 'apache' package.

*UseSyslog*::
	Log action messages through syslog(). This will insert log entries into
	``/var/log/messages'' or equivalent.

*ShowSize*::
	Display the size of individual packages for '\--sync' and '\--query' modes.

*UseDelta*::
	Download delta files instead of complete packages if possible.  Requires
	the xdelta program to be installed.


Repository Sections
-------------------
Each repository section defines a section name and at least one location where
the packages can be found. The section name is defined by the string within
square brackets (the two above are 'current'  and  'custom'). Locations are
defined with the 'Server' directive and follow a URL naming structure. If you
want to use a local directory, you can specify the full path with a ``file://''
prefix, as shown above.

The order of repositories in the file matters; repositories listed first will
take precedence over those listed later in the file when packages in two
repositories have identical names, regardless of version number.

Using Your Own Repository
-------------------------
If you have numerous custom packages of your own, it is often easier to generate
your own custom local repository than install them all with the '\--upgrade'
option. All you need to do is generate a compressed package database in the
directory with these packages so pacman can find it when run with '\--refresh'.

	repo-add /home/pkgs/custom.db.tar.gz /home/pkgs/*.pkg.tar.gz

The above command will generate a compressed database named
'/home/pkgs/custom.db.tar.gz'. Note that the database must be of the form
'{treename}.db.tar.gz', where '{treename}' is the name of the section defined in
the configuration file. That's it! Now configure your custom section in the
configuration file as shown in the config example above. Pacman will now use your
package repository. If you add new packages to the repository, remember to
re-generate the database and use pacman's '\--refresh' option.

For more information on the repo-add command, see ``repo-add \--help'' or
manlink:repo-add[8].
