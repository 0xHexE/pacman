== This is my custom TODO file ==
* gensync: get all info from packages instead of PKGBUILDs
  for now, we only need to check the PKGBUILD in case of a
  'force' option
* gensync and makepkg: support for 1 _or more_ file integrity
  algorithms at a time (mostly done).
* pacman: add pactest cases/functionality for all -Q operations and make sure
  the output is sane
