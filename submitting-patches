HOWTO: Submit a patch
---------------------

This document is here mainly to make my job easier, and is more of a guideline,
and not a strict set of rules.  Please try to follow as much as you can.

NOTE: Much of this is paraphrased from the kernel documentation's
"SubmittingPatches" file.

Creating your patch:

* Use "diff -up" or "diff -uprN" to create patches.

  These options make the diff easier to read for those of us who try to review
  submitted patches.

* Please try to make patches "p1 applicable"

  This means that if you are patching file "lib/libalpm/alpm.h", I should be
  able to apply your patch while passing the -p1 argument to 'patch'.  The diff
  header should look like so:

  --- ORIGINAL_DIR/lib/libalpm/alpm.h
  +++ NEW_DIR/lib/libalpm/alpm.h

  With '-p1' the ORIGINAL_DIR and NEW_DIR arguments are stripped.

Submitting your patch:

* No MIME, no links, no compression, no attachments.  Just plain text.

  Patches should be contained in the actual body of the email.  There are many
  reasons for this.  Firstly, it makes them easier to read with any mail reader,
  it allows easier review "at a glance", and most importantly, it allows people
  to comment on exact lines of the patch in reply emails.

  It is important to know that the diff format ignores plain text before (and
  after) the main diff itself.  If you directly insert your patch into an email,
  you can safely add lines above it describing your patch.

* Describe your patch.
