Here is a brief description of the files included in this directory:

bash_completion - a bash completion script for pacman, install in
/etc/bash_completion.d/ for use (but rename to something descriptive!).

zsh_completion - a zsh completion script, install (with a rename) to
/usr/share/zsh/site-functions/.

pacsearch - a colorized search combining both -Ss and -Qs output. Installed
packages are easily identified with a *** and local-only packages are also
listed.

pacdiff - a simple pacnew/pacorig/pacsave updater for /etc/.

re-pacman - regenerate a pacman package based on installed files and the pacman
database entries. Useful for reuse, or possible config file extension.
