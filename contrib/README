Here is a brief description of the files included in this directory:

PKGBUILD.proto, proto.install - prototype PKGBUILD and install files for
creating packages using makepkg.

PKGBUILD.vim - a vim/gvim syntax file for PKGBUILDs. Colors known variable
names, highlights common errors such as invalid characters in pkgname or
pkgver, etc.

bash_completion - a bash completion script for pacman, install in
/etc/bash_completion.d/ for use (but rename to something descriptive!).

zsh_completion - a zsh completion script, install (with a rename) to
/usr/share/zsh/site-functions/.

pacdiff - a simple pacnew/pacorig/pacsave updater for /etc/.

pacsearch - a colorized search combining both -Ss and -Qs output. Installed
packages are easily identified with a *** and local-only packages are also
listed.

re-pacman - regenerate a pacman package based on installed files and the pacman
database entries. Useful for reuse, or possible config file extension.

vimproject - a project file for the vim project plugin (some files listed
may need to be updated).

wget-xdelta.sh - A download script for pacman which allows binary deltas
generated with makepkg to be used instead of downloading full binary packages.
This should cut download sizes for some package upgrades significantly.
