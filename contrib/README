Here is a brief description of the files included in this directory:

PKGBUILD.vim - a vim/gvim syntax file for PKGBUILDs. Colors known variable
names, highlights common errors such as invalid characters in pkgname or
pkgver, etc.

bash_completion - a bash completion script for pacman, install in
/etc/bash_completion.d/ for use (but rename to something descriptive!).

zsh_completion - a zsh completion script, install (with a rename) to
/usr/share/zsh/site-functions/.

pacdiff - a simple pacnew/pacorig/pacsave updater for /etc/.

paclist - list all packages installed from a given repository. Useful for
seeing which packages you may have installed from the testing repository,
for instance.

pacsearch - a colorized search combining both -Ss and -Qs output. Installed
packages are easily identified with a *** and local-only packages are also
listed.

pactree - generate a dependency tree of an installed package in textual or
graphical form (using graphviz).

bacman - regenerate a pacman package based on installed files and the pacman
database entries. Useful for reuse, or possible config file extension.

vimprojects - a project file for the vim project plugin.

wget-xdelta.sh - A download script for pacman which allows binary deltas
generated with makepkg to be used instead of downloading full binary packages.
This should cut download sizes for some package upgrades significantly.

gensync, updatesync - The former repository management scripts that have since
been superseded by repo-add and repo-remove. They are here for posterity's
sake, and to show how repo-add and repo-remove can be wrapped in other scripts.
