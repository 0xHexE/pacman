Name
----
verify-pacman-repo-db - package repository verification utility


Synopsis
--------
'verify-pacman-repo-db' [options]


Description
-----------
'verify-pacman-repo-db' looks at a pacman repo database and verifies its
content with the actual package files. The database is expected to be in
the same directory as the packages (or symlinks to the packages).

The following properties are verified for each package in the database:

	 - existence of the package file
	 - file size
	 - MD5 and SHA256 checksum (--checksum)

Options
-------
*-h, \--help*::
	Output a short help message.

*\--debug*::
	Enable debug output.

*-c, \--checksum*::
	Verify checksums of packages. Note that this means all packages files will
	be read from disk. Otherwise only metadata is compared which does not
	require to read package file contents.

*-t, \--threads* <number>::
	Use 'number' threads to verify packages. Note that each thread may use up
	to approximately 128MiB of memory. Default: 1

Notes
-----

This script does intentionally not use any ALPM libraries. The format is simple
enough to be parsed and this way we might just detect more problems because the
libalpm parsing code might also have bugs. We also stay much more portable
which might be good for people that want to check a db, but don't actually have
pacman installed.
