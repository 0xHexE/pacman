GLOBAL
======

- add i18n (gettext) support

- get ride of "ORE" tags.


LIBALPM
=======

- remove the dependency with /usr/bin/chroot (implement the chroot handling
using the chroot() syscall)

- review errors handling (globalise pm_errno usage, improve error 
meanings)

- documentation (doxygen? man pages for public functions? ...)


PACMAN
======

- implement missing functionnalities (mainly handling of package conflicts
during packages replacement)

- review how things are displayed in the frontend (normal display,
verbose mode, which usage for the library log callback, debug levels, ...)

- add HTTP support for .lastupdate files


ADDITIONAL IDEAS FOR PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT
============================================

- idea from Christian Hamar: have a /var/lib/pacman/{repo}/.cache file
that basically contains the output of `ls -1 /var/lib/pacman/{repo}`.  This
cache file could be used in -Q and -Si/s operations to speed up package
listings.
