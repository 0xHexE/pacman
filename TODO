GLOBAL
======
- ORE tags - are there any left?
- Automake is a PITA.  We should switch to just autoconf and hand written
  Makefile.in's

LIBALPM
=======
- review public interface.  There seems to be a lot of complication
  for consuming front ends for no reason.  I have some ideas for a "new and
  improved" public interface, but it would be a drastic change.

- review errors handling (globalise pm_errno usage, improve error 
  meanings)


PACMAN
======
- review how things are displayed in the frontend (normal display,
  verbose mode, which usage for the library log callback, debug levels, ...)

- review progress / transaction even subsystem
