ADDITIONAL IDEAS FOR PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT
============================================

- idea from Christian Hamar: have a /var/lib/pacman/{repo}/.cache file
that basically contains the output of `ls -1 /var/lib/pacman/{repo}`.  This
cache file could be used in -Q and -Si/s operations to speed up package
listings.
